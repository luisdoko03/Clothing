This is a project for a clothing store in Java worked with Net-Beans IDE using GUI. The operator of this store will receive 
the order from the customer and the system will calculate the total amount of the purchase including the tax and also print the invoice.
This system will save time and will be easier to use compared to handwritten invoices.
This system is made for an existing online store that is:
ILYRIAN BLOODLINEÂ®
All product photos and prices are taken from the Illyrian Bloodline website.
